# Assignement 3 - Replication of the Gyllenhaal experiment
 
### Contributors: Lou Schubert, Matthieu Fraticelli, David Schwitzgebel

A small repo to create a replication of the gyllenhaal experiment for the Cultural Evolution course.

The code is using jsPsych to implement a way to collect the data locally in a .csv file, after collecting the responses on-site at ENS.
